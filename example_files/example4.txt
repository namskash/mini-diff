The forest was quiet, save for the occasional rustle of leaves in the wind.
Birds chirped from the canopy, unseen but not unheard.
Sunlight filtered through the trees in narrow, golden shafts.
A fox darted through the underbrush, its eyes alert and ears perked.
The stream nearby bubbled softly, its sound steady and calming.
A distant howl echoed faintly â€” perhaps a wolf, or just the wind.
