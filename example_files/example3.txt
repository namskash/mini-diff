The forest was quiet, save for the occasional rustle of leaves in the wind.
Birds chirped from the canopy, unseen but not unheard.
A fox darted through the underbrush, its eyes alert and ears perked.
The stream nearby bubbled softly, its sound steady and calming.
Moss-covered stones lined the trail, slick from the morning dew.
